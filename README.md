# Water quality prediction using R and Python

### DO       
For predicting DO using BOD and Temperature best is LASSO(6.558347)
Overall best is step wise (6.655898)
By analysing and applying regression we found although theoretically DO(dissolved oxygen) depends upon BOD(biological oxygen demand) and temperature but practically it depends on a lot of other factors.   
#### On advanced analysis it was found that the best model is Extratreesregressor.        
### Nitrate     
Multiple Linear Regression is best(1.446844)                       
### Ph         
Best is Linear Regression.(Since adjusted R square is more and residual standard error is less)


Note :- water is suitable for drinking if there is optimal ph and DO level is good. Also nitrate level must be less. 

kindly install required packages else you may get error.
